* Smaller things:
** Fix the code to give fewer warnings when compiled with -Wall

   There are tons of small things in the code that spit out warnings in GHC or
   hlint.  Fixing this would likely improve code quality a bit.

** Update this TODO
   There is probably more things to do that aren't named in here.


* Larger things:
** Should we only allow bytestring as key to avoid serialize/deserialze?

  This could give lower memory usage, since nodes could remains as packed
  bytestrings at all times. Some c-functions could be introduce to manipulate
  these in an safe yet efficient way (copy on change).

** Complete the implementations of findMin and findMax.

  Currently, min and max values can only be located if they reside in an
  outermost leaf. Due to the nature of eventual-balance and lazy rebalancing
  this is not always the case. The outermost leaf could be empty.
